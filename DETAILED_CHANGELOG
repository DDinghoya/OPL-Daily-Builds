rev969 - Jay-Jay-OPL - SP193: Change in the PS2SDK about libpwroff. - In one commit last year, I changed its design (along with AUDSRV) to use SIFRPC instead because of the change in design of the user SIFCMD buffer. - Unfortunately, i didn't add proper re-initialization code to the new design of libpwroff. - So when OPL starts the HDLDump server the old libpwroff SIFRPC server is contacted and the EE crashes. - Server was broken in r878, and this change was made in 09-27-2016, working well again in r930. - Adjusted the HDLDump server thread priorities for proper functionality of the transfer data. - Update README. - Mon Oct 24 18:55:31 2016 -0700
